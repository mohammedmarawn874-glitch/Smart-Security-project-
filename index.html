    <h2 class="title">Summer project</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>My Summer of Solutions project focuses on creating an AI-driven smart security systemdesigned to improve safety
        in public and private spaces. The idea is to move beyond traditional
        CCTV monitoring by using real-time computer vision to detect unusual behavior, suspiciousmovements, and
        potential threats automatically
        The system can analyze video streams instantly, highlight activities that need attention, andsend alerts to
        security staff without any manual monitoring. It also uses basic predictive
        analytics to identify patterns that may lead to incidents, helping security teams respondfaster
        and prevent problems before they escalate. The solution is meant to be simple, scalable, and suitable for places
        like malls, schools, residential areas, or workplaces. It reduces the pressure on human guards, increases
        responsespeed, and provides a more reliable layer of protection. Overall, the project aims to make security
        smarter, more proactive, and easier to manageusingAI.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Problem Statement (Smart Security):</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Traditional security systems rely heavily on human monitoring, which makes it difficult todetect
        threats, unusual behavior, or incidents in real time. Security staff cannot track multiple camerasefficiently,
        leading to delayed responses and missed risks. This results in unsafe environmentsin public spaces, malls,
        schools, and residential areas. There is a clear need for a smarter, faster, and more reliable security
        approach.</p>

      <p>We install cameras throughout the city to monitor everything that happens in the city</p>

      <p>It analyzes all cases, such as theft, kidnapping, fire, fainting, and inappropriate behavior, andsends a
        message detailing the case, its location, and its nature. It also captures images of theincident, identifies the
        individuals involved, and searches for them in the database to facilitatethe search for the person in cases of
        theft, kidnapping, or any other crime</p>
